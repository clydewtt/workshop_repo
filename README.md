# workshop_repo

Welcome Hax Lab!

You will all be assigned a task number. Your task will be to fix the bug in the code and make a pull request of your code!

**DO NOT** merge **your own** pull request to the main branch!

Look at your partner's pull request, read their code and leave a comment of approval or improvement points!

**You are allowed to merge your pull request only when you have a comment on your pull request!**
